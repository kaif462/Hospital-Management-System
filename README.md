The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive command-line application designed to simulate the essential operations of a modern healthcare facility. It streamlines the workflow of administrative, medical, and support staff through an efficient and structured system.

Unlike basic hospital record apps, this project is built on a fully normalized multi-table database capable of handling complex relationships between patients, doctors, appointments, departments, billing records, and medical histories. The system ensures accuracy, consistency, and scalability for real-world use.

It also includes an intelligent Lazy Initialization Mechanism, which automatically generates and configures the entire database schema on the first launch. This makes the project a plug-and-play solution, requiring no manual setup.
